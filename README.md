# Minecraft Server Automation Scripts

Start, Stop, and Backup scripts for Minecraft servers on Ubuntu. I am running the server in a [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux) session via [systemd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemd) as a daemonized service. 

## Features

* Create backups of world folder
* Start/stop server scripts
* Usable with cron jobs

## Credits

These scripts are adapted from the valuable resources below.
